### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 only had one part, but it was one of my favorite Labs. This is the first lab were I created a program that ran, and was properly formatted. It may seem like a simple lab, but at the time I was quite new to computer science, so creating the program, brought lots of joy, and gave me confidence in my abilities.

* Lab 1
    
    Lab 1, was my welcome to "computer science moment." This was not a difficult lab at all, but I was new to code spaces and to the computer science environment. I took the entirety of the lab to setup my computer, and to create an account. I recall trying to edit my source code in the terminal. I figured it out eventually, and it made the rest of my labs easier.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part two, was favorite portion of this whole lab course. This was the first time we encountered functions. I liked because it was very rewarding when all the tests passed. I was also able to calculate how many days apart my friends and I were born with this program.
